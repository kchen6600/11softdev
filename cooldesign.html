	<h1 class="fancy">I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo.</h1>
	<div class="basic">
	<p>Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!</p>
	<p>Noooooo! Do a flip! <strong> I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians.</strong> <em> It must be wonderful.</em> Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing.</p>
	</div>
	<h2>I can explain. It's very valuable.</h2>
	<div class="basic2">
	<p>There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! It's toe-tappingly tragic! I never loved you. Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!</p>
	<ol>
	<li>I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want!</li><li>I love you, buddy!</li><li>Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.</li>
	</ol>
	</div>

	<h3 class="fancy">That's the ONLY thing about being a slave.</h3>
	<div class="basic">
	<p>I never loved you. Anyone who laughs is a communist! Oh sure! Blame the wizards! That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Bender?! You stole the atom.</li><li>No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires!</li><li>You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!</li>
	</ul>

	<p>These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. Fatal. Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Who are you, my warranty?! Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?</p>
	<p>We're also Santa Claus! That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? We're also Santa Claus! It must be wonderful.</p>
	<p>But I've never been to the moon! Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. Leela's gonna kill me. And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!</p>
	<p>OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. A true inspiration for the children. Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!</p>
	<p>Ummm…to eBay? Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?</p>
	<p>Then we'll go with that data file! Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say. Shut up and get to the point!</p>
	<p>Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! Then we'll go with that data file!</p>
	<p>I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.</p>
	<p>Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?</p>
	<p>That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.</p>
	<p>You mean while I'm sleeping in it? Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?</p>
